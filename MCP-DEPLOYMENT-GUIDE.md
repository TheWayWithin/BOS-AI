# BOS-AI MCP Integration - Deployment Guide

## Quick Start for Your Business Projects

The MCP automation system has been developed in the BOS-AI library. To use it in your business projects, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Check What You Currently Have

First, let's see what MCPs are available in your Claude Code environment:

```bash
claude mcp list
```

### Step 2: Copy MCP Integration to Your Business Projects

For each of your business projects, you need to:

1. **Copy the MCP automation files** from BOS-AI development to your business project
2. **Run the installation script** to set up MCPs
3. **Configure environment variables** for services you use

### Step 3: Quick Setup for Each Business Project

Here's what to do for each project:

#### For ai-search-mastery-business:
```bash
cd /Users/jamiewatters/BusinessProjects/ai-search-mastery-business

# Copy the MCP system files (we'll create a deployment script for this)
cp -r /Users/jamiewatters/DevProjects/BOS-AI/src/mcp ./src/
cp -r /Users/jamiewatters/DevProjects/BOS-AI/scripts/install-bos-ai-mcps.sh ./scripts/
cp -r /Users/jamiewatters/DevProjects/BOS-AI/scripts/check-mcp-status.sh ./scripts/
cp /Users/jamiewatters/DevProjects/BOS-AI/workspace/config/mcp-registry.yaml ./workspace/config/
cp /Users/jamiewatters/DevProjects/BOS-AI/.env.mcp-template ./

# Run the MCP installation
./scripts/install-bos-ai-mcps.sh

# Check status
./scripts/check-mcp-status.sh
```

#### Repeat for SoloMarket and Evolve-7 Business

## What You Actually Need to Do Right Now

Since the MCP system is built but not yet packaged for distribution, here's the immediate path:

### Option 1: Manual Testing in One Project First

1. Pick one business project to test with (suggest: ai-search-mastery-business)
2. We'll create a simple deployment script that copies the necessary files
3. Test the MCP integration there
4. Once working, deploy to other projects

### Option 2: Create a BOS-AI Package Update

1. Package the MCP system into the BOS-AI library properly
2. Update your business projects' BOS-AI installation
3. MCPs will be available automatically

## The Simplest Path Forward

Let me create a deployment script that will:
1. Package the MCP system from the development project
2. Deploy it to your business projects
3. Run the installation automatically

Would you like me to:
- A) Create a deployment script to copy the MCP system to one of your business projects for testing?
- B) Show you how to manually test MCPs in your current environment first?
- C) Package this into a proper BOS-AI library update?

## What the MCP System Does for Your Business Projects

Once deployed, your business projects will have:

1. **Automatic MCP Detection**: Agents will know which MCPs are available
2. **Smart Fallbacks**: If MCPs aren't connected, agents use alternatives
3. **Better Agent Performance**: Agents can access GitHub, Stripe, databases, etc.
4. **Zero Configuration**: It works automatically after initial setup

## Current Reality Check

The MCP automation system exists in these locations:
- **Development**: `/Users/jamiewatters/DevProjects/BOS-AI/` (fully built)
- **Your Business Projects**: Not yet deployed

The gap: We need to get the MCP system FROM the development project TO your business projects.

## Next Steps

Tell me which approach you prefer:
1. **Test in one project first** - I'll create a script to deploy to ai-search-mastery-business
2. **Package for all projects** - I'll create a proper BOS-AI update
3. **Manual setup** - I'll guide you through manual MCP setup for immediate use

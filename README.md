## 🔌 MCP Integration - Supercharge Your Agents

### What is MCP (Model Context Protocol)?

MCP enables BOS-AI agents to connect directly with external services and tools, providing:
- **Direct API Access**: Agents can interact with GitHub, Stripe, databases, and more
- **Real-time Data**: Access live information instead of cached or simulated data
- **Enhanced Capabilities**: Agents perform actions directly rather than providing instructions
- **Automatic Detection**: Agents automatically detect and use available MCPs
- **Intelligent Fallbacks**: When MCPs aren't available, agents seamlessly fall back to standard methods

### How MCP Works with BOS-AI

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[BOS-AI Agent] --> B{MCP Available?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Direct MCP Connection]
    B -->|No| D[Intelligent Fallback]
    C --> E[Enhanced Performance]
    D --> F[Standard Performance]
    E --> G[Task Complete]
    F --> G
```

### Automatic MCP Setup

When you install BOS-AI with MCP support, the system:

1. **Detects Available MCPs**: Automatically finds which MCPs are configured in Claude Code
2. **Configures Registry**: Creates a registry tracking MCP availability
3. **Updates Agents**: All agents become MCP-aware automatically
4. **Implements Fallbacks**: Ensures agents work even without MCPs

```bash
# Check MCP status after installation
./scripts/check-mcp-status.sh

# Setup MCPs (if in Claude Code)
./scripts/setup-mcps.sh
```

### Available MCP Integrations

| MCP Service | What It Enables | Agent Benefits |
|------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **GitHub** | Repository access, issue tracking | Direct code management, PR creation |
| **Stripe** | Payment analytics, revenue data | Real-time financial insights |
| **Filesystem** | Enhanced file operations | Faster file management |
| **IDE** | Code diagnostics, execution | Better development support |
| **Linear** | Project management | Direct task creation and tracking |
| **Slack** | Team communication | Automated notifications |
| **Databases** | Direct data access | Real-time analytics |

### How Agents Use MCPs

```bash
# Example: Market Intelligence Agent with MCPs
@market-intelligence "analyze competitors"

# With MCP (Firecrawl): 
# → Directly scrapes competitor websites
# → Retrieves real-time pricing data
# → Analyzes actual traffic patterns

# Without MCP (Fallback):
# → Uses WebSearch for public data
# → Provides research guidance
# → Suggests manual data collection
```

### Setting Up API Keys

After installation, configure your service API keys:

```bash
# 1. Copy the template
cp .env.mcp-template .env

# 2. Edit .env and add your keys
# Example:
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
STRIPE_API_KEY=your_stripe_key

# 3. Run setup to configure MCPs
./scripts/setup-mcps.sh
```

### MCP Performance Impact

| Operation | Without MCP | With MCP | Improvement |
|-----------|------------|----------|-------------|
| GitHub Issue Creation | 3-5 steps, manual | 1 step, automatic | 80% faster |
| Stripe Analytics | Export CSV, analyze | Real-time query | 90% faster |
| Market Research | Multiple searches | Direct scraping | 70% more data |
| File Operations | Command simulation | Direct execution | 95% faster |

### Zero-Configuration Experience

BOS-AI's MCP system is designed to "just work":
- **No Manual Setup Required**: MCPs are detected automatically
- **Graceful Degradation**: Agents work with or without MCPs
- **Transparent Operation**: Agents report which MCPs they're using
- **Automatic Updates**: Registry updates as MCPs become available

## The Complete Solopreneur Business Operating System

BOS-AI represents the evolution of business management from fragmented tools and processes into a unified, AI-augmented framework that enables individual entrepreneurs to compete through **systematic excellence** rather than resource accumulation. This system integrates the continuous innovation cycle of **Discovery-Creation-Delivery-Growth** with the mathematical precision of **Business Chassis optimization** while incorporating comprehensive AI agent coordination.

### Core Philosophy: 10x Value at 1/10th Cost

Built around the fundamental principle that solopreneurs achieve competitive advantage through **systematic excellence**, **speed of execution**, and **direct customer relationships** rather than trying to replicate enterprise approaches. The BOS Framework enables entrepreneurs to work **ON** their business using strategic intelligence and systematic frameworks, then work **IN** their business using AI-created assets, plans, and standard operating procedures.

## The Business Chassis: Mathematical Foundation for Exponential Growth

At the heart of BOS-AI lies the **Business Chassis** - six components that multiply together to create profit:

```
Prospects × Lead Conversion × Client Conversion × Average Spend × Transaction Frequency × Margin = Profit
```

**The Multiplication Advantage:**
- 10% improvement in each component = **77% increase in profit**
- 100% improvement in each component = **6,400% increase in profit**

The genius lies in the **fix-the-holes methodology**: start improvements with margin (bottom of the bucket) and work upward. There's no point attracting more prospects if your margins are terrible or your conversion rates are broken.

## 📝 How Agents Use Documents

BOS-AI agents know exactly where to find templates and where to save your documents:

### Template Library Location
**All templates are in `.claude/document-library/`** - This is where agents look for templates and SOPs when creating or updating your business documents.

### Your Document Locations
Agents organize YOUR documents in these locations:
- **`documents/foundation/`** - Your vision, mission, market research, positioning
- **`documents/foundation/prds/`** - Product requirements documents
- **`documents/operations/`** - Operational documents
- **`documents/archive/`** - Version history
- **`assets/reports/`** - Generated analysis and reports

### How It Works in Practice

```bash
# Example: Update your Vision & Mission
/coord vision-mission-update

# Agent workflow:
1. Reads template from: .claude/document-library/Vision and Mission.md
2. Follows SOP from: .claude/document-library/Vision and Mission Development SOP (Rapid AI-Driven).md
3. Creates/updates your document: documents/foundation/vision-mission.md
```

```bash
# Example: Create Strategic Roadmap
/coord strategic-roadmap

# Agent workflow:
1. Uses template: .claude/document-library/Strategic Roadmap_ Vision to Great.md
2. Follows process: .claude/document-library/Strategic Roadmap Creation SOP (AI-Driven).md
3. Saves your roadmap: documents/foundation/strategic-roadmap.md
```

### Document Naming Convention
Agents use the YYYY-MM-DD format for generated reports:
- Reports: `2025-08-30-report-market-analysis.md`
- Metrics: `2025-08-30-metrics-revenue.md`
- Plans: `2025-08-30-plan-q4-launch.md`

This ensures chronological organization and easy retrieval.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting & FAQ

### Installation Issues

**Problem: Installation script fails with "command not found"**
```bash
# Solution: Ensure curl is installed
which curl  # Check if curl exists
# If not, install curl first (varies by OS)
```

**Problem: "Permission denied" error**
```bash
# Solution: Ensure you're in a writable directory
cd ~/your-project  # Go to your project directory
ls -la            # Check permissions
```

**Problem: Agents not appearing in Claude Code**
```bash
# Solution: Verify installation location
ls -la .claude/agents/  # Should show .md files
# Re-run installation if needed
```

### MCP Issues

**Problem: MCPs not connecting**
```bash
# Solution 1: Check MCP status
./scripts/check-mcp-status.sh

# Solution 2: Verify you're in Claude Code
claude mcp list  # Should show available MCPs

# Solution 3: Re-run setup
./scripts/setup-mcps.sh
```

**Problem: "MCP not available" messages**
```bash
# This is normal! Agents will use fallbacks
# To enable MCPs:
1. Open project in Claude Code
2. Run: ./scripts/setup-mcps.sh
3. Add API keys to .env file
```

**Problem: API authentication failures**
```bash
# Solution: Check your API keys
cat .env  # Verify keys are set
# Test specific service
claude mcp test github  # Test GitHub MCP
```

### Usage Questions

**Q: How do I know which agents are installed?**
```bash
ls .claude/agents/  # Lists all installed agents
```

**Q: Can I upgrade from starter to full later?**
```bash
# Yes! Just run the full installation
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheWayWithin/BOS-AI/main/deployment/scripts/install.sh | bash -s full
```

**Q: How do I uninstall BOS-AI?**
```bash
rm -rf .claude/  # Removes all BOS-AI files
```

**Q: Do I need to install in every project?**
- Yes, BOS-AI installs per-project to keep your projects isolated
- This allows different projects to use different agent configurations

**Q: What are MCPs and do I need them?**
- MCPs (Model Context Protocol) enhance agent capabilities
- Not required - agents work without them using fallbacks
- Enable better performance when available

**Q: How do I enable MCPs?**
```bash
# After installation, run:
./scripts/setup-mcps.sh
# Add API keys to .env file for services you use
```

**Q: Will agents work without MCPs?**
- Yes! All agents have intelligent fallback mechanisms
- MCPs enhance performance but aren't required
- System degrades gracefully when MCPs unavailable

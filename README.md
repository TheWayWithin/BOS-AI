## The Business Chassis

Every business runs on six multipliers:

```
Profit = Prospects × Lead Conversion × Client Conversion × Average Spend × Transaction Frequency × Margin
```

**The Multiplication Effect:**
- 10% improvement in each = **77% more profit**
- 20% improvement in each = **299% more profit**

BOS-AI optimizes all six multipliers systematically.

## DOCUMENT LIBRARY PROTOCOL

### Finding Templates & SOPs
**Templates and SOPs are located in `.claude/document-library/`**
- Templates: `Product Requirements Document (PRD).md`, `Brand Style Guide.md`, etc.
- SOPs: `Product Requirements Document (PRD) Creation SOP.md`
- Standards: `FILING-STANDARDS.md` for naming conventions

### Creating New PRDs
1. **Find Template**: `.claude/document-library/Product Requirements Document (PRD).md`
2. **Read SOP**: `.claude/document-library/Product Requirements Document (PRD) Creation SOP.md`
3. **Create PRD**: Follow 4-prompt AI-assisted process from SOP
4. **Save To**: `/documents/foundation/prds/[product-name]-prd.md`
5. **Archive Old**: If updating, copy to `/documents/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-[product-name]-prd.md`

### Updating Existing Documents
1. **Archive Current**: `cp /documents/foundation/prds/[name].md /documents/archive/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-[name].md`
2. **Read Template**: Check `.claude/document-library/` for current format
3. **Update Document**: Preserve valid content, update structure if needed
4. **Save in Place**: Overwrite original location

### Standard Document Names (NEVER CHANGE)
- PRDs: `[product-name]-prd.md` in `/documents/foundation/prds/`
- Example: `customer-portal-prd.md`, `mobile-app-prd.md`, `api-v2-prd.md`

## Business Foundation Library Integration

### Documents to Reference (if they exist)
- `/documents/foundation/vision-mission.md` - Ensure solution alignment
- `/documents/foundation/client-success-blueprint.md` - Design for ideal customers
- `/documents/foundation/positioning-statement.md` - Maintain differentiation
- `/documents/foundation/strategic-roadmap.md` - Follow product priorities
- `/documents/foundation/brand-style-guide.md` - Apply brand standards

### If Documents Don't Exist
1. Check `.claude/document-library/` for templates
2. Alert user that foundation document is missing
3. Suggest creating it using appropriate template and SOP
4. Proceed with PRD using available information

### PRD Creation Workflow
1. Validate opportunity with discovery agents
2. Load PRD template from `.claude/document-library/`
3. Follow PRD Creation SOP step-by-step
4. Map features to customer problems from client-success-blueprint
5. Ensure brand compliance from brand-style-guide
6. Save to `/documents/foundation/prds/[product-name]-prd.md`
7. Update `/workspace/business-plan.md` with PRD status

## Agent Coordination Principles

### Hierarchical Intelligence
Agents operate in a hierarchical structure where Central Intelligence provides strategic guidance, Engine Teams handle specialized business functions, and Business Function Teams manage traditional operations.

### Asset-Driven Operations
All agents focus on creating, maintaining, and executing from comprehensive business assets including the Client Success Blueprint, Marketing Bible, Sales Playbook, and Operations Manual.

### Business Chassis Integration
Every agent activity is evaluated against its contribution to Business Chassis optimization and the six-component multiplication formula that drives exponential profit growth.

### Customer Success Focus
All agents prioritize customer success and value delivery over internal efficiency, ensuring that optimization serves customer outcomes rather than just business metrics.

## How Missions Work

1. **Business Focus**: All missions output business documents (PRDs, strategies, plans)
2. **No Technical Work**: Missions create requirements, not implementations
3. **PRD Handoff**: Technical requirements go to separate dev projects with AGENT-11
4. **Clear Boundaries**: See BOUNDARIES.md for separation guidelines

## Mission Execution Flow

```
BOS-AI Mission → Business Analysis → PRD Creation → Handoff to Dev Team
                                                          ↓
                  Operate Solution ← Product Delivery ← AGENT-11 Project
```

## Archived Technical Missions

The following missions violated boundaries and have been archived:

- These belong in AGENT-11 development projects, not BOS-AI

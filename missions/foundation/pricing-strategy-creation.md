# Mission: Pricing Strategy Creation

**Mission Type:** Foundation Document Creation
**Duration:** 60-90 minutes
**Output:** `/documents/foundation/Pricing Strategy.md`

---

## Mission Objective

Create a comprehensive Pricing Strategy document with value-based pricing tiers, Marketing Physics (Doug Hall) at product and tier levels, and FoMo-driven upgrade messaging that guides customers up the value ladder.

## Required Agents

- `revenue-optimization` (primary) - Pricing architecture and value optimization
- `solution-design` (support) - Product value articulation
- `brand-strategy` (support) - Marketing Physics alignment

---

## Reference Documents

**Before starting this mission, read these reference documents:**

| Document | Purpose | Location |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **Pricing Strategy SOP** | Process methodology and prompts | `/docs/Document Library/Foundation/Pricing Strategy Creation SOP (AI-Driven).md` |
| **Pricing Strategy Template** | Output document structure | `/docs/Document Library/Foundation/Pricing Strategy Template.md` |

**Key Sections from SOP:**
- Foundation Analysis (customer value language, competitive pricing, segments)
- Tier Structure Development (architecture, feature allocation, core value)
- Marketing Physics Application (product-level and tier-level)
- Conversion Optimization (competitive comparison, upgrade triggers, objection handling)

## Prerequisites (Foundation Documents Required)

| Document | What You'll Extract |
|----------|---------------------|
| **Vision and Mission** | Core promise, values, long-term positioning |
| **Market Research** | Competitor pricing, market rates, alternatives |
| **Client Research** | Customer segments, pain points, value language |
| **Client Success Blueprint** | Customer journey stages, success metrics |
| **Positioning Statement** | Differentiators, unique value proposition |

**Note:** Pricing Strategy should be created AFTER these foundation documents are complete.

## PHASE 0: MODE SELECTION

**Before proceeding, ask the user:**

> **How would you like to create your Pricing Strategy?**
>
> | Mode | Description | Time |
> |------|-------------|------|
> | **Auto** | I'll create the complete Pricing Strategy based on your inputs. You review and refine at the end. | 30-45 min |
> | **Engaged** | We work section by section. I draft, present perspectives, you approve before moving on. | 60-90 min |
>
> Which mode works for you today?

**Wait for user response before proceeding.**

---

## PHASE 1: CONTEXT GATHERING

Gather essential context:

1. **Read provided foundation documents** (vision-mission, market research, client research, positioning)
2. **Ask clarifying questions:**
   - What product/service are we pricing?
   - How many tiers are you considering? (typically 3-5)
   - Any existing pricing to consider?
   - What's your primary pricing metric? (contacts, seats, usage, features)
   - Who are your main competitors and their pricing?
   - What do customers currently pay for alternatives?

---

## AUTO MODE EXECUTION

If user selected **Auto**:

### Step 1: Generate Complete Document

Using the Pricing Strategy Template, create complete document with:

1. **Pricing Philosophy** - Value-based positioning and principles
2. **Pricing Tiers Overview** - Table of all tiers with metrics and prices
3. **Product-Level Marketing Physics**
   - Dramatic Difference (why fundamentally different)
   - Overt Benefits (clear, tangible customer value)
   - Real Reasons to Believe (proof supporting claims)
   - Product-Level FoMo (vs. alternatives)
4. **Individual Tier Details** - For each tier:
   - Target customer and Job-to-be-Done
   - Feature table with limits
   - Why This Tier Exists (strategic rationale)
   - Tier-Level Marketing Physics (OB, DD, RR2B, FoMo)
   - Upgrade Trigger Message
5. **Feature Breakdown** - Core value (all tiers) + tier-exclusive features
6. **Value Ladder Summary** - Progression logic and transition drivers
7. **Competitive Comparison** - What customers pay today vs. your solution
8. **Upgrade Triggers** - Specific signals for each tier transition
9. **Objection Handling** - Common concerns with value-focused responses
10. **Pricing Page Structure** - Hero, comparison callout, tier cards, FAQ

### Step 2: Present for Review

Show complete document and iterate until approved.

### Step 3: Save Document

Save to `/documents/foundation/Pricing Strategy.md`

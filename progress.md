2. **Updated source files** in `/agents/` directory structure
   - Added required `name`, `description`, and `tools` fields
   - Maintained consistency across all 30 agents
   - Ensured proper deployment to `.claude/agents/`

3. **Established Rule #1** for agent development:
   - SOURCE: Always edit in `/agents/[category]/` 
   - DEPLOYED: Never edit `.claude/agents/` directly
   - Clear workflow: Edit → Deploy → Verify

### 📋 Enhanced Planning & Progress Tracking - COMPLETED ✅

**Issue Identified:** Missions would start without proper planning, leading to lost progress if system crashed.

**Resolution Implemented:**
1. **Mandatory Planning Phase** in `/coord` command:
   - TodoWrite integration required before delegation
   - Mission plan documentation in `/workspace/business-plan.md`
   - Agent sequence documentation
   - Progress dashboard initialization

2. **Progress Tracking System**:
   - TodoWrite tool tracks all mission tasks
   - Checkpoint files created after each agent
   - Mission dashboard for real-time visibility
   - Workspace files maintain persistent state

**Resolution Implemented:**
1. **Removed all AGENT-11 technical agents** from BOS-AI
   - Deleted: developer, tester, architect, designer, operator, documenter, analyst, coordinator, strategist, marketer, support
   - These agents belong in separate development projects, not BOS-AI

2. **Restored 29 pure business agents** focused on business operations
   - All agents now strictly prohibited from technical implementation
   - Agents create PRDs, not code

3. **Created BOUNDARIES.md** documenting strict separation
   - BOS-AI: Defines WHAT to build (business requirements)
   - AGENT-11: Implements HOW to build (technical development)
   - Clear handoff protocol via PRDs

4. **Updated all 29 agents** with guardrails preventing:
   - Writing production code
   - Designing technical architecture
   - Performing software testing
   - Handling deployment/DevOps
   - Making technology decisions

### 📚 Document Library Implementation - COMPLETED ✅

   - Business setup missions (foundation, chassis implementation)
   - Discovery missions (market research, competitive analysis)
   - Growth missions (market expansion, revenue optimization)
   - Operations missions (daily/weekly/quarterly reviews)

3. **Updated remaining missions** to:
   - Focus only on business operations
   - Output business documents (PRDs, strategies, plans)
   - Use only BOS-AI's 29 business agents
   - Respect BOS-AI/AGENT-11 boundaries

### 🚀 Deployment Script Updates - COMPLETED ✅

**New `deploy-bos-ai.sh` script:**

## Agent Coordination Patterns

### Hub-and-Spoke Model
All agents coordinate through @chassis-intelligence:
```
User â†’ @chassis-intelligence â†’ Specialist Agents â†’ Results
```

### Multi-Agent Missions
Complex tasks use multiple agents:
```
/coord product-launch
â†’ @market-intelligence (research)
â†’ @solution-design (product)
â†’ @campaign-execution (marketing)
â†’ @pipeline-management (sales)
```

### Direct Consultation
Specific expertise via /meeting:
```
/meeting @agent-name "specific question"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start with /coord optimize** - Let the system identify priorities
2. **Use specialists for deep dives** - Each agent has focused expertise
3. **Chain agents for complex tasks** - Combine multiple agents
4. **Track metrics** - Monitor Business Chassis improvements
5. **Document decisions** - Agents create filing system documents

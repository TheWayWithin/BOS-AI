## Phase 1: Foundation Analysis (45 minutes)

### Step 1.1: Extract Customer Value Language (15 minutes)

**Pull from Client Research and Client Success Blueprint:**

```
AI Prompt:

Analyze these foundation documents to extract customer value language for pricing.

CLIENT RESEARCH:
[Paste relevant sections from Client Research document]

CLIENT SUCCESS BLUEPRINT:
[Paste customer journey and success metrics sections]

Please identify:
1. The specific problems customers describe (in their words)
2. The outcomes they value most (what success looks like to them)
3. The language they use to describe value and ROI
4. Their current spending on alternatives (tools, time, money)
5. Their decision criteria when evaluating solutions
6. Pain points at each journey stage that pricing can address

Format as a value language guide for pricing strategy.
```

### Step 1.2: Analyze Competitive Pricing Landscape (15 minutes)

**Pull from Market Research:**

```
AI Prompt:

Analyze competitive pricing to inform our strategy.

MARKET RESEARCH DATA:
[Paste competitor and alternative pricing from Market Research]

OUR POSITIONING:
[Paste core positioning statement]

Please analyze:
1. What customers currently pay for alternatives (itemized)
2. Total cost of ownership (tools + time + effort)
3. Price anchors we can use (expensive alternatives)
4. Pricing models competitors use (per-seat, usage-based, flat)
5. Gaps in competitor pricing we can exploit
6. Value propositions competitors miss at each price point

Provide competitive pricing intelligence for positioning our tiers.
```

### Step 1.3: Define Customer Segments for Tiers (15 minutes)

**Pull from Client Research and Client Success Blueprint:**

```
AI Prompt:

Define distinct customer segments that will map to pricing tiers.

CUSTOMER PERSONAS:
[Paste ideal customer profiles from Client Research]

CUSTOMER JOURNEY STAGES:
[Paste journey stages from Client Success Blueprint]

OUR VISION:
[Paste from Vision and Mission - who we serve at what stage]

Please create:
1. 3-5 distinct customer segments based on business stage/size
2. For each segment: typical revenue, team size, sophistication level
3. Their "Job to be Done" at their current stage
4. What they value most at this stage (features vs. support vs. price)
5. Natural triggers that would move them to next segment
6. Recommended tier name that resonates with each segment

Format as segment profiles ready for tier mapping.
```

---

## Phase 2: Tier Structure Development (60 minutes)

### Step 2.1: Design Tier Architecture (20 minutes)

**Use outputs from Phase 1:**

```
AI Prompt:

Design pricing tier architecture based on customer segments.

CUSTOMER SEGMENTS:
[Paste segment profiles from Step 1.3]

COMPETITIVE PRICING:
[Paste analysis from Step 1.2]

VALUE LANGUAGE:
[Paste value language guide from Step 1.1]

Create tier architecture including:
1. Number of tiers (typically 3-5) with names that resonate
2. Primary metric that scales (contacts, usage, seats, etc.)
3. Price points for each tier (annual and monthly)
4. Target customer segment for each tier
5. Key differentiation between adjacent tiers
6. Annual vs. monthly pricing premium rationale

Ensure each tier:
- Has a clear "Why This Tier Exists" strategic purpose
- Creates natural progression up the value ladder
- Leaves clear gaps that drive upgrades (intentional FoMo)
- Aligns with customer's perceived value at their stage

Format as tier architecture ready for feature allocation.
```

### Step 2.2: Allocate Features Across Tiers (20 minutes)

```
AI Prompt:

Allocate features across pricing tiers for maximum upgrade motivation.

TIER ARCHITECTURE:
[Paste tier structure from Step 2.1]

PRODUCT CAPABILITIES:
[List all features/capabilities your product offers]

CUSTOMER VALUE PRIORITIES:
[Paste what customers value at each stage from Phase 1]

For each tier, define:
1. Features included at this tier
2. Limits/caps on usage-based features
3. Support level and SLA
4. "Why This Tier Exists" strategic rationale

Apply these allocation principles:
- Core value delivered at every tier (no feature gating of core promise)
- Higher tiers get "automation" not just "more" (prevention → solution → autopilot)
- Each tier jump should feel like 10x value for 2x price
- Missing features at lower tiers should create genuine pain, not annoyance
- Support/SLA improvements justify premium tiers

Format as detailed feature tables per tier.
```

### Step 2.3: Define Core Value (All Tiers) (20 minutes)

```
AI Prompt:

Define the core value proposition included at ALL tiers.

TIER FEATURE ALLOCATION:
[Paste feature tables from Step 2.2]

OUR POSITIONING:
[Paste positioning statement]

Create "All Tiers Include" section:
1. Core features that deliver on main promise (never gated)
2. Why these features must be universal
3. How this differentiates from competitors who gate basics
4. Risk reversal elements (trial, guarantee, etc.)

The goal: Every tier delivers the core promise. Higher tiers deliver it faster, better, or with less effort.

Format as core value table for pricing page.
```

POSITIONING STATEMENT:
[Paste full positioning statement]

COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE:
[Paste key differentiators vs. alternatives]

CUSTOMER VALUE LANGUAGE:
[Paste from Phase 1]

Create comprehensive Marketing Physics:

1. DRAMATIC DIFFERENCE (Why we're fundamentally different)

2. OVERT BENEFITS (Clear, tangible customer value)
   - Primary benefit (single most important)
   - 5 supporting benefits in customer language
   - Each benefit should be specific and measurable

3. REAL REASONS TO BELIEVE (Proof supporting claims)
   - 5-7 proof points with specific evidence
   - Each proof point should be verifiable by customers
   - Include: experience, results, methodology, guarantees

4. PRODUCT-LEVEL FoMo (vs. Alternatives)
   - For each major alternative, what customers are missing
   - Frame as loss/pain, not just features missing
   - Make the cost of NOT choosing us viscerally clear

Format as complete product-level Marketing Physics section.
```

### Step 3.2: Tier-Level Marketing Physics (45 minutes)

**Apply Marketing Physics to EACH TIER:**

   For each key feature at this tier:
   - Feature name
   - Benefit in customer language ("I finally..." or "I no longer...")
   - Make benefits emotional AND practical

2. DRAMATIC DIFFERENCE

   - How it positions them for future growth

3. REAL REASONS TO BELIEVE
   3-4 proof points specific to this tier's claims:
   - Why this tier's limits are sufficient
   - Evidence that features work as promised
   - Testimonials or use cases at this tier level

4. FoMo - WHAT YOU'RE MISSING (Drive to Next Tier)
   For 3-5 features NOT included at this tier:
   - Feature name
   - Specific pain/cost of not having it
   - Frame as loss, not just absence
   - Make the gap feel urgent but not punishing

5. UPGRADE TRIGGER MESSAGE
   One compelling sentence that addresses the FoMo and promises value
   - Acknowledge they've outgrown current tier
   - Promise specific value in next tier
   - Create urgency without pressure

Format as complete tier-level Marketing Physics section.
```

**Repeat Step 3.2 for each tier in your pricing structure.**

### Step 3.3: Create Value Ladder Summary (15 minutes)

```
AI Prompt:

Create a value ladder summary connecting all tiers.

ALL TIER MARKETING PHYSICS:
[Paste completed Marketing Physics for each tier]

Create:

1. PROGRESSION LOGIC

   Table showing From → To → Primary Driver → Secondary Driver
   What specifically causes customers to upgrade?

3. MARKETING PHYSICS BY TIER
   Summary table with:
   - Tier name
   - Dramatic Difference (short)
   - Overt Benefit (short)
   - Key RR2B (single strongest proof)

This becomes the strategic overview for pricing page design.

## Pro Tips

**For Marketing Physics:**
- Dramatic Difference should be truly unique, not just "better"
- Overt Benefits must be in customer language, not product speak
- RR2B should be verifiable - customers should be able to check
- FoMo should create genuine desire, not guilt or shame

**For Value Ladder:**
- Each tier jump should feel like 10x value for 2x price
- Never gate core value - gate speed, scale, or automation
- Missing features should create genuine pain, not annoyance
- Top tier should feel aspirational, not exclusive

**For Conversion:**
- Anchor high with competitive comparison first
- Present recommended tier prominently
- Risk reversal removes friction better than discounts
- Upgrade messages should celebrate growth, not push sales

**Remember:** Great pricing isn't about maximizing revenue per customer - it's about aligning price with value so customers feel they're getting a bargain at every tier.

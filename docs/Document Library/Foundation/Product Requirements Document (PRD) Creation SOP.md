# Product Requirements Document (PRD) Creation SOP

**Version:** 1.0  
**Author:** Manus AI  
**Date:** August 28, 2025  
**Purpose:** Create comprehensive PRDs using AI prompts that integrate strategic foundation documents for solopreneur product development

## Overview

This SOP creates Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) that provide developers with complete specifications for technical design, build, testing, and deployment. Each PRD is created for a single product using AI prompts that integrate insights from Vision/Mission, Market Research, Client Success Blueprint, Brand Bible, and Strategic Roadmap.

**Total Time:** 3-4 hours using AI-powered prompts  
**Approach:** Strategic integration with developer-ready specifications  
**Output:** Complete PRD ready for development team execution

## Core Philosophy

The PRD serves as the bridge between strategic vision and technical execution. It translates business requirements into developer-ready specifications while ensuring alignment with brand identity, customer needs, and strategic objectives. For solopreneurs, the PRD enables clear communication with development teams (internal or external) and ensures products are built to serve ideal customers effectively.

**Key Principles:**
- **Strategic Alignment** - Every feature connects to vision and customer success
- **Developer Clarity** - Unambiguous specifications for technical implementation
- **Customer Focus** - Features designed to solve real problems for ideal people
- **Brand Consistency** - Visual and experience standards aligned with brand identity
- **Solopreneur Practical** - Realistic scope and resource requirements

## Prerequisites

- Completed Vision and Mission document
- Market and Client Research report
- Client Success Blueprint
- Brand Style Guide
- Strategic Roadmap (specific product identified)
- Understanding of target product from roadmap

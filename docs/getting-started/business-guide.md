## Getting Started

### Installation

Open your terminal and run this single command:

```bash
mkdir ~/my-business && cd ~/my-business && git init
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheWayWithin/BOS-AI/main/deployment/scripts/install.sh | bash -s full
```

That's it. BOS-AI is now ready to run your business operations.

### Your First Command

Start Claude Code in your business directory, then use the most powerful command in BOS-AI:

```bash
claude code .
/coord optimize
```

This command analyzes your entire business through the Business Chassis lens and identifies your biggest opportunity for growth. It will:

1. Ask you about your current business metrics
2. Analyze each component of your Business Chassis
3. Identify the weakest link (your biggest opportunity)
4. Recommend the specific mission to fix it

**What to expect:** A 10-15 minute strategic conversation that gives you clarity on where to focus your energy for maximum impact.

> **Pro Tip:** Run `/coord optimize` whenever you're unsure what to work on next. It always points you toward your highest-leverage opportunity.

## Understanding the Business Chassis

The Business Chassis is the foundation of everything BOS-AI does. It's a simple formula that explains how businesses actually grow:

### The Multiplication Formula

```
Profit = Prospects × Lead Conversion × Client Conversion × Average Spend × Transaction Frequency × Margin
```

Every business, regardless of industry, runs on these six numbers:

| Component | What It Means | Example |
|-----------|--------------|--------|
| **Prospects** | People who see your business | Website visitors, ad impressions |
| **Lead Conversion** | Prospects who become leads | Email signups, demo requests |
| **Client Conversion** | Leads who become customers | First purchases, closed deals |
| **Average Spend** | Revenue per transaction | Order value, contract size |
| **Transaction Frequency** | How often customers buy | Monthly subscriptions, repeat orders |
| **Margin** | Profit per dollar of revenue | After costs are covered |

### Why Multiplication Beats Addition

Here's the magic: because these components multiply together, small improvements create exponential results.

| Improvement Level | Impact on Each Component | Total Profit Increase |
|------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| 10% improvement | 1.1x per component | **77% more profit** |
| 20% improvement | 1.2x per component | **299% more profit** |
| 50% improvement | 1.5x per component | **1,139% more profit** |

Most businesses obsess over getting more prospects (advertising). But improving conversion rates, average spend, and margin often delivers faster results with less effort.

### The "Fix the Holes" Methodology

BOS-AI uses a strategic approach: **start from margin and work backward**.

Why? Because improving margin means every existing customer becomes more profitable. Then improving frequency means they buy more often. Work your way up the chain:

1. **Margin** → Keep more of what you earn
2. **Transaction Frequency** → Existing customers buy more often
3. **Average Spend** → Each transaction is worth more
4. **Client Conversion** → More leads become customers
5. **Lead Conversion** → More prospects become leads
6. **Prospects** → Reach more potential customers

This approach compounds your improvements. When you finally increase prospects, every other component is already optimized to convert them.

## Foundation Documents

### Why Strategic Foundation Matters

Before jumping into marketing campaigns or sales scripts, you need strategic clarity. Foundation documents answer the fundamental questions:

- Who are you?
- Who do you serve?
- What problem do you solve?
- Why should anyone choose you?
- Where are you going?

Without these answers, every other effort is guesswork. With them, every decision becomes easier.

### The 8 Foundation Documents

BOS-AI helps you create these essential documents:

| Document | Purpose | Key Questions Answered |
|----------|---------|------------------------|
| **Vision & Mission** | Your north star | Why does your business exist? Where are you heading? |
| **Market Research** | Know your battlefield | Who are your competitors? What do customers really want? |
| **Client Blueprint** | Your target audience | Who buys from you? What do they care about? |
| **Positioning Statement** | Your market position | Why choose you over alternatives? |
| **Strategic Roadmap** | Your path forward | What happens this quarter? This year? |
| **Brand Guide** | Your voice and identity | How do you look, speak, and feel to customers? |
| **Pricing Strategy** | Your value exchange | How do you capture value? What's your pricing model? |
| **PRD** | What you're building | What solution are you offering? What features matter? |

### Building Your Foundation (3-4 Hours)

Run the foundation quick-start to build all essential documents:

```
/coord foundation-quick-start
```

This guided mission will:
- Walk you through each document in logical order
- Ask you the right questions
- Generate professional documents ready for your team
- Create a foundation that powers all future operations

> **Important:** Foundation documents define WHAT you want to accomplish. They become the source of truth for all business operations.

### Individual Foundation Commands

If you prefer to create documents one at a time:

```bash
/coord vision-mission-creation        # 45-90 min - Your North Star
/coord market-research-creation       # 60-120 min - Market landscape
/coord client-blueprint-creation      # 45-90 min - Ideal Customer Profile
/coord positioning-creation           # 30-60 min - Differentiation
/coord roadmap-creation               # 45-75 min - Strategic milestones
/coord brand-guide-creation           # 45-90 min - Visual & voice identity
/coord pricing-strategy-creation      # 60-90 min - Value ladder & tiers
/coord prd-creation                   # 60-120 min - Product requirements
```

### Foundation Document Tips

- **Be specific:** "Small business owners" is too vague. "Restaurant owners with 10-50 employees in urban areas" gives you clarity.
- **Be honest:** If you don't know your competitors well, say so. Better to identify gaps than pretend they don't exist.
- **Iterate:** Your first draft won't be perfect. These documents evolve as your business grows.

## Operations Systems

## Daily Operations & Growth

### Daily Chassis Review

Start each day with a quick business pulse check:

```
/coord daily
```

This gives you:
- Key metrics overview
- Yesterday's wins and issues
- Today's priorities
- Alerts for anything needing attention

**Time required:** 5-10 minutes

Every week, take time for deeper analysis:

```
/coord weekly
```

- Week-over-week metric comparisons
- Business Chassis component analysis
- Trend identification
- Recommendations for the coming week

**Time required:** 20-30 minutes

### Finding Your Biggest Opportunity

Whenever you need strategic direction:

```
/coord optimize
```

BOS-AI will analyze your current Business Chassis and identify:
- Your weakest component (biggest opportunity)
- The specific mission to improve it
- Expected impact on your profit

### The Continuous Improvement Cycle

Business growth isn't a one-time project—it's a cycle:

```
┌─────────────┐
│   Measure   │  ← /coord daily, /coord weekly
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│   Analyze   │  ← /coord optimize
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│   Improve   │  ← Run recommended mission
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│   Repeat    │  ← Back to measuring
└─────────────┘
```

Every cycle makes your business stronger. Small, consistent improvements compound into massive results.

## Need Software Built?

Sometimes business growth requires custom software—a customer portal, mobile app, automation system, or digital product.

### When You Might Need Technical Implementation

- Building a SaaS product
- Creating customer-facing applications
- Automating complex workflows
- Developing digital products to sell

### Creating a Product Requirements Document

BOS-AI helps you define WHAT to build:

```
/coord solution-design "your product idea"
```

This creates a Product Requirements Document (PRD) that specifies:
- What the software should do
- Who it's for
- What success looks like
- Business requirements and constraints

### Technical Implementation

BOS-AI focuses on business operations—it doesn't write code. For technical implementation, you have two options:

1. **Hand off to developers:** Give your PRD to your technical team
2. **Use AGENT-11:** A separate AI-powered development system designed to work with BOS-AI PRDs

> **For the complete technical workflow:** See the [Product Developer Guide](developer-guide.md)

The key point: BOS-AI handles everything business-related. When you need software built, you create requirements here, then build elsewhere.

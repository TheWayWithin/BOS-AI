Each stage builds on the previous one, creating a foundation for sustainable growth.

---

## Stage 1: Foundation

**Purpose**: Establish strategic clarity before taking action.

### What Happens in Foundation

Foundation is where you answer the fundamental questions:
- Who are you?
- Who do you serve?
- What problem do you solve?
- Why should anyone choose you?
- Where are you going?

### Foundation Documents

| Document | Purpose | Time |
|----------|---------|------|
| Vision & Mission | Your north star and purpose | 45-90 min |
| Market Research | Understanding your battlefield | 60-120 min |
| Client Blueprint | Defining your ideal customer | 45-90 min |
| Positioning Statement | Your unique market position | 30-60 min |
| Strategic Roadmap | Your path forward | 45-75 min |
| Brand Guide | Your visual and verbal identity | 45-90 min |
| Pricing Strategy | Your value exchange model | 60-90 min |
| PRD | Product/service requirements | 60-120 min |

### Why Foundation Matters

Without foundation documents, every decision becomes guesswork. With them:
- Marketing knows who to target and what to say
- Sales knows what problems to solve
- Service knows what success looks like
- Finance knows what value to charge

**Command**: `/coord foundation-quick-start`

---

## Stage 2: Creation

**Purpose**: Design and build solutions that deliver 10x value.

### What Happens in Creation

This stage transforms your foundation into tangible offerings:
- Solution design based on customer needs
- Product/service development
- Systems and process creation
- Value proposition refinement

### For Business-Only Users

If you're running a business without building software, creation means:
- Creating service packages
- Developing consulting frameworks
- Building operational systems
- Designing customer experiences

### For Product Developers

If you're building software products, creation involves:
1. Create PRD in BOS-AI (defines WHAT to build)
2. Hand off to AGENT-11 project (builds HOW)
3. Return to BOS-AI for operations

**Commands**:
- `/coord solution-design "your product idea"` - Design your solution
- `/coord prd-creation` - Create product requirements document

---

## Stage 3: Delivery

**Purpose**: Execute with excellence and optimize for customer success.

### What Happens in Delivery

Delivery is where strategy meets execution:
- Marketing reaches your ideal customers
- Sales converts leads to customers
- Service ensures customer success
- Quality assurance maintains standards

### The Four Operations Systems

| System | Focus | Impact on Business Chassis |
|--------|-------|---------------------------|
| Marketing | Attract and engage | Prospects ↑, Lead Conversion ↑ |
| Sales | Convert and close | Client Conversion ↑, Average Spend ↑ |
| Customer Service | Retain and grow | Transaction Frequency ↑, Margin ↑ |
| Finance | Optimize and invest | Margin ↑, Strategic decisions |

### Setting Up Operations

```bash
/coord marketing-system-setup      # 4-5 hours
/coord sales-system-setup          # 3-4 hours
/coord customer-service-system-setup  # 3-4 hours
/coord finance-system-setup        # 3-4 hours
```

Each system creates:
- **Bible**: Strategic foundation and principles
- **Plan**: Tactical execution playbook
- **Calendar** (Marketing): Content and campaign schedule

---

## Stage 4: Growth

**Purpose**: Scale what works and expand your impact.

### What Happens in Growth

Growth builds on operational excellence:
- Scaling successful strategies
- Entering new markets
- Expanding product/service lines
- Optimizing profitability

### Growth Levers

| Lever | Strategy | Example |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Market Expansion | Enter new segments | Geographic expansion |
| Product Extension | Add complementary offerings | Premium tiers |
| Channel Optimization | Improve efficiency | Automation |
| Partnership Development | Leverage relationships | Strategic alliances |

### Growth Commands

```bash
/coord optimize           # Find biggest growth opportunity
/coord scale              # Develop scaling strategy
/coord market-entry       # Plan new market expansion
```

## The Continuous Improvement Loop

The lifecycle isn't linear—it's a continuous loop:

```
┌─────────────┐
│   Measure   │  ← /coord daily, /coord weekly
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│   Analyze   │  ← /coord optimize
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│   Improve   │  ← Run recommended mission
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│   Repeat    │  ← Back to measuring
└─────────────┘
```

### Daily Operations

```bash
/coord daily    # 5-10 minutes - Quick business pulse
```

### Weekly Review

```bash
/coord weekly   # 20-30 minutes - Performance analysis
```

### Continuous Optimization

```bash
/coord optimize # Find and fix the weakest link
```

## Time Investment by Stage

| Stage | First Time | Ongoing |
|-------|------------|---------|
| Foundation | 8-12 hours | Quarterly review |
| Creation | Varies by project | Per initiative |
| Delivery | 13-17 hours setup | Daily operations |
| Growth | 2-4 hours per initiative | Continuous |

---

## Stage Selection Guide

### Where to Start

| If You're... | Start With | Rationale |
|--------------|------------|-----------|
| Just starting a business | Stage 1: Foundation | Build on solid ground |
| Have strategy, need execution | Stage 3: Delivery | Operationalize your vision |
| Have operations, want growth | Stage 4: Growth | Scale what's working |
| Need to build software | Stage 2: Creation | Design before building |

### When to Revisit Stages

- **Revisit Foundation**: When pivoting, entering new markets, or annually
- **Revisit Creation**: When launching new products or major updates
- **Revisit Delivery**: When operations aren't meeting targets
- **Revisit Growth**: Quarterly for scaling opportunities

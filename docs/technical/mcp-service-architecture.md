## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive Model Context Protocol (MCP) service architecture for BOS-AI, designed to enhance the 25+ agent ecosystem through systematic integration of external services, tools, and data sources. The architecture follows THE ARCHITECT's principles of simple scaling solutions that actually work, choosing proven technologies over bleeding-edge complexity.

### Architecture Decision Record

**Decision:** Implement comprehensive MCP service layer with 12 core service categories supporting the four-engine innovation cycle and traditional business functions.

**Context:** BOS-AI requires sophisticated external integrations to enable agent coordination, data persistence, automation capabilities, and monitoring across Discovery, Creation, Delivery, and Growth engines.

**Trade-offs:**
- **Positive:** Enhanced agent capabilities, systematic data management, automated workflows, comprehensive monitoring
- **Negative:** Increased complexity, additional service dependencies, higher operational overhead

**Implementation:** Progressive rollout starting with core services (Context7, Git, Playwright) followed by specialized services for each engine team.

**Risks:** Service dependency failures, authentication complexity, performance bottlenecks from external API calls

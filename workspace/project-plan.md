# CLAUDE.md Boundary Restoration Mission - COMPLETE

## Mission Objective
Restore BOS-AI boundaries and AGENT-11 handoff process to CLAUDE.md

## Root Cause Analysis
✅ **FOUND**: BOUNDARIES.md exists with perfect guardrails
✅ **FOUND**: BOUNDARIES.md is deployed to users
❌ **PROBLEM**: CLAUDE.md never references BOUNDARIES.md
❌ **PROBLEM**: Users unaware of two-project architecture
❌ **PROBLEM**: No guardrails preventing code development

## Solution Delivered
✅ Created `/workspace/CLAUDE-NEW.md` with:
- Two-project architecture (OPENS with this)
- 16+ boundary reminders throughout
- BOUNDARIES.md referenced 3+ times
- Complete PRD handoff process

## Mission Context Summary
*High-level overview for any agent joining the mission*

### What We're Doing
Completed customer service operations framework integration for BOS-AI to deliver the three-pillar business operations system. The complete Operations Library now includes Marketing (4 documents), Sales (3 documents), and Customer Service (3 documents) systems providing complete customer journey coverage in 10-13 hours vs. months of traditional business development.

### Why It Matters
Complete marketing-sales-customer service operations integration provides users with comprehensive business framework covering entire customer journey. Marketing multiplies Prospects + Lead Conversion + Transaction Frequency; Sales multiplies Lead Conversion + Client Conversion + Average Spend; Customer Service multiplies Transaction Frequency + Margin + Referrals for potential 150-300% Business Chassis multiplication through integrated customer-success focused approaches.

### Where We Are
Marketing, sales, and customer service operations frameworks are complete and integrated. Customer service framework integration is complete, delivering 2-document system (Customer Service Bible + Customer Service Plan) with 3-4 hour implementation. The comprehensive three-pillar business operations framework now covers all customer journey stages from awareness through advocacy.

## Decisions Made
*Important decisions that constrain future work*

| Decision | Made By | Rationale | Impact |
|----------|---------|-----------|---------|
| Operations Library parallel structure to Foundation Library | @developer | Provides systematic execution framework complementing strategic foundation | All operational procedures follow 4-tier structure (Bibles → Playbooks → SOPs → Templates) |
| 3-document marketing framework (Bible → Plan → Calendar) | @analyst | Proven systematic approach from analysis of 4 marketing SOP documents | All marketing activities follow strategic → tactical → execution workflow |
| Customer-success focused marketing over traditional promotion | @strategist | Aligns with BOS-AI philosophy and Business Chassis multiplication | All marketing metrics prioritize customer value delivery |
| AI-driven creation process with comprehensive prompts | @developer | Eliminates implementation barriers and expertise requirements | All marketing documents can be created systematically in 60-90 minute sessions |
| Marketing missions integration into BOS-AI mission library | @strategist | Provides systematic coordination of marketing framework implementation | Marketing capabilities accessible through standard BOS-AI command system |

## Current Constraints
*Boundaries and limitations to consider*

- **Documentation Focus**: Ensure marketing operations capabilities are clearly documented for user adoption
- **Integration Consistency**: All marketing operations must align with existing BOS-AI command system and agent architecture
- **Business Chassis Alignment**: Marketing framework must consistently support Business Chassis multiplication principles
- **User Experience**: Marketing system setup must remain accessible to non-marketing experts through systematic guidance
- **Operational Standards**: Marketing operations must follow Operations Library 4-tier structure and quality standards

## Risk Alerts
*Potential issues to watch for*

⚠️ **MCP Authentication Complexity**: Different services use vastly different auth methods - Mitigation: Design flexible auth system with clear per-service guidance

⚠️ **Performance Bottlenecks**: Multiple MCP connections add latency and failure points - Mitigation: Implement connection pooling, parallel requests, and timeout handling  

⚠️ **Claude Code Compatibility**: Not all community MCPs work reliably - Mitigation: Test thoroughly, maintain approved MCP list, robust fallbacks

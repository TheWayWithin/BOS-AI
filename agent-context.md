# BOS-AI Documentation Review Mission - Agent Context

**Mission**: Complete review of documentation to reflect current BOS-AI operations with Claude Code SDK enhancements
**Started**: Current session
**Mission Lead**: THE COORDINATOR (AGENT-11)

## Mission Background

The user has identified that BOS-AI documentation needs comprehensive review to ensure it reflects how the system now operates after significant enhancements including:

1. **Claude Code SDK Integration**: Memory systems, extended thinking, context editing, security protocols, self-verification
2. **Enhanced Agent Capabilities**: All 30 agents now have memory integration, thinking modes, tool permissions
3. **Updated Mission Architecture**: Task() delegation syntax, memory protocols, verification systems
4. **Command System Evolution**: Enhanced coord, pmd, report commands with business intelligence
5. **Comprehensive Business Intelligence**: Cross-session learning, institutional memory, error prevention

## Current System State

### Recently Completed Enhancements:
- ✅ All 30 agents updated with Claude Code SDK enhancements
- ✅ Memory integration protocol implemented across all agents
- ✅ Extended thinking mode assignments (ultrathink → standard)
- ✅ Security-first tool permissions with audit trails
- ✅ Self-verification protocols with 5-step error recovery
- ✅ Commands updated with memory-driven intelligence
- ✅ Key missions updated with Task() delegation syntax
- ✅ Main CLAUDE.md updated with Claude Code SDK Enhanced Operations section

### Documentation Files Requiring Review:
- README.md (primary entry point)
- Supporting documentation files
- Installation guides
- Architecture documentation
- User guides and quick start materials

## Mission Objectives

1. **Accuracy**: Ensure all documentation reflects actual current operations
2. **Completeness**: Document Claude Code SDK enhancements comprehensively
3. **Consistency**: Align all documents with new capabilities and protocols
4. **Usability**: Maintain clear user guidance while documenting advanced features

## Success Criteria

- All documentation accurately reflects current BOS-AI operations
- Claude Code SDK enhancements properly documented
- No misleading or outdated information remains
- Clear guidance for users on new capabilities
- Professional presentation suitable for GitHub repository

## Agent Handoff Protocol

Each specialist will:
1. Read this context and handoff notes from previous agent
2. Complete assigned documentation analysis/updates
3. Update this context with findings and decisions
4. Create handoff notes for next specialist
5. Log any issues or discoveries in progress.md

# Standard Operating Procedure: Business Chassis Optimization

## Purpose
Systematically optimize the six Business Chassis multipliers to achieve exponential profit growth through compound improvements.

## Scope
Applies to all business optimization activities focused on improving:
- Prospects
- Lead Conversion
- Client Conversion
- Average Spend
- Transaction Frequency
- Margin

## Procedure

### 1. Initial Assessment (Week 1)

#### 1.1 Data Collection
- [ ] Gather 12 months of historical data
- [ ] Calculate current multiplier values
- [ ] Document baseline metrics
- [ ] Identify data gaps

#### 1.2 Multiplier Analysis
- [ ] Calculate each multiplier's current performance
- [ ] Benchmark against industry standards
- [ ] Identify weakest multiplier (biggest constraint)
- [ ] Calculate potential impact of improvements

#### 1.3 Documentation
- [ ] Create Chassis Scorecard
- [ ] Document findings in `/assets/reports/YYYY-MM-DD-chassis-baseline.md`
- [ ] Share with stakeholders

### 2. Bottleneck Identification (Week 2)

#### 2.1 Constraint Analysis
- [ ] Apply Theory of Constraints to each multiplier
- [ ] Identify primary bottleneck
- [ ] Calculate bottleneck impact on overall system
- [ ] Prioritize improvement opportunities

#### 2.2 Root Cause Analysis
- [ ] Conduct 5-why analysis on bottleneck
- [ ] Map process flows
- [ ] Identify systemic issues
- [ ] Document improvement hypotheses

### 3. Optimization Planning (Week 3)

#### 3.1 Strategy Development
- [ ] Design improvement experiments
- [ ] Set measurable targets (minimum 10% improvement)
- [ ] Create implementation timeline
- [ ] Assign responsibilities

#### 3.2 Resource Allocation
- [ ] Budget for improvements
- [ ] Allocate team resources
- [ ] Identify required tools/systems
- [ ] Plan for contingencies

### 4. Implementation (Weeks 4-8)

#### 4.1 Execution
- [ ] Launch improvement initiatives
- [ ] Track daily/weekly progress
- [ ] Adjust tactics based on results
- [ ] Maintain momentum

#### 4.2 Monitoring
- [ ] Daily metric tracking
- [ ] Weekly progress reviews
- [ ] Bi-weekly stakeholder updates
- [ ] Real-time adjustments

### 5. Measurement & Iteration (Ongoing)

#### 5.1 Results Analysis
- [ ] Calculate actual improvements
- [ ] Compare to targets
- [ ] Document lessons learned
- [ ] Identify next bottleneck

#### 5.2 Continuous Improvement
- [ ] Move to next weakest multiplier
- [ ] Apply learnings from previous cycle
- [ ] Compound improvements
- [ ] Scale successful tactics

## Key Metrics

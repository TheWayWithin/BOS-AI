# üöÄ BOS-AI Command System & Business Orchestration

Welcome to BOS-AI - Your AI-powered Business Operating System focused on exponential growth through Business Chassis optimization.

## üî¥ RULE #1: AGENT DEVELOPMENT DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

**CRITICAL - ALWAYS FOLLOW THIS STRUCTURE:**

### Source Directory (EDIT HERE):
üìÅ `/agents/` - **THIS IS WHERE YOU WORK ON AGENTS**
- All agent development happens in `/agents/` directory
- Organized by category (coordination, creation, delivery, etc.)
- This is the SOURCE OF TRUTH for all agents
- **NEVER edit agents in `.claude/agents/` directly**

### Deployment Directory (READ-ONLY):
üìÅ `.claude/agents/` - **DO NOT EDIT HERE**
- This is the DEPLOYED location for Claude Code to use
- Automatically populated by deployment scripts
- Any manual edits here will be overwritten
- Treat as read-only runtime directory

### Correct Workflow:
1. **EDIT** agents in `/agents/[category]/[agent-name].md`
2. **TEST** locally if needed
3. **DEPLOY** using installation scripts
4. **VERIFY** agents appear in `.claude/agents/`

### Example:
```
‚úÖ CORRECT: Edit /agents/discovery/market-intelligence.md
‚ùå WRONG: Edit .claude/agents/market-intelligence.md
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: BOS-AI vs AGENT-11 Separation

**BOS-AI** is a BUSINESS OPERATING SYSTEM - it runs your business, NOT your code.
- **BOS-AI**: Creates PRDs, defines requirements, manages business operations
- **AGENT-11**: Separate system that builds software from BOS-AI's PRDs
- **NEVER**: BOS-AI agents do NOT write code, test software, or handle deployment
- **See BOUNDARIES.md** for complete separation guidelines

## üéØ Command System

### `/coord` - Business Orchestration Mode
When you type `/coord`, I become your **Chassis Intelligence Coordinator** - the central orchestrator for all business operations. This activates my strategic coordination persona to manage multi-agent workflows.

## üìä Business Chassis Formula

The mathematical foundation of exponential growth:

```
Profit = Prospects √ó Lead Conversion √ó Client Conversion √ó Average Spend √ó Transaction Frequency √ó Margin
```

**The Multiplication Effect:**
- 10% improvement in each = **77% profit increase**
- 20% improvement in each = **299% profit increase**
- 50% improvement in each = **1,139% profit increase**

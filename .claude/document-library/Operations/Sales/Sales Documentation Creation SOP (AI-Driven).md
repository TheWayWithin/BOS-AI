**Version:** 1.0  
**Author:** Manus AI  
**Date:** August 28, 2025  
**Purpose:** Create comprehensive sales documentation using AI prompts integrated with strategic foundation and marketing documents

## Overview

This SOP creates two essential sales documents that form the complete sales framework for solopreneurs: Sales Bible (comprehensive sales reference) and Sales Plan (tactical sales activities). Each document is created using AI prompts that integrate insights from all strategic foundation documents and marketing documentation.

**Total Time:** 3-4 hours using AI-powered prompts  
**Approach:** Customer success-focused sales with authentic relationship building  
**Output:** Complete sales documentation framework ready for implementation

## Core Philosophy

Sales documentation translates customer success philosophy into practical sales processes that help ideal customers make informed decisions about solutions that genuinely benefit them. For solopreneurs, these documents ensure sales efforts focus on serving customer success rather than traditional persuasion-based selling.

**Key Principles:**
- **Customer Success Focus** - Sales helps customers achieve their success, not just business revenue
- **Authentic Relationships** - Sales builds genuine relationships based on mutual value
- **Problem-Solution Fit** - Sales ensures customers get solutions that truly help them
- **Educational Approach** - Sales educates customers to make informed decisions
- **Value Alignment** - Sales aligns customer needs with genuine value we provide

## Prerequisites

- Completed Vision and Mission document
- Market and Client Research report
- Client Success Blueprint
- Brand Style Guide
- Strategic Roadmap
- Marketing Bible
- Marketing Plan
- Understanding of customer success philosophy and authentic sales approach

## The 2-Document Sales Framework

**Version:** 1.0  
**Author:** Manus AI  
**Date:** August 28, 2025  
**Purpose:** Create comprehensive marketing documentation using AI prompts integrated with strategic foundation documents

## Overview

This SOP creates three essential marketing documents that form the complete marketing framework for solopreneurs: Marketing Bible (strategic reference), Marketing Plan (tactical campaigns), and Content Calendar (content execution). Each document is created using AI prompts that integrate insights from all strategic foundation documents.

**Total Time:** 4-5 hours using AI-powered prompts  
**Approach:** Strategic integration with practical marketing execution  
**Output:** Complete marketing documentation framework ready for implementation

For solopreneurs, these documents ensure marketing efforts are focused, consistent, and aligned with customer success rather than generic promotion.

**Key Principles:**
- **Customer Success Focus** - Marketing helps customers understand how we solve their problems
- **Strategic Alignment** - All marketing connects to vision, mission, and customer success
- **Brand Consistency** - Marketing expresses brand personality and values consistently
- **Resource Efficiency** - Marketing activities fit solopreneur time and budget constraints
- **Authentic Communication** - Marketing communicates genuine value in customer language

## Prerequisites

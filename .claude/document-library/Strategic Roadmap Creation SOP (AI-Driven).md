# Strategic Roadmap Creation SOP (AI-Driven)

**Version:** 1.0  
**Author:** Manus AI  
**Date:** August 27, 2025  
**Purpose:** Strategic roadmap from Vision to Great through keystone product identification and sequencing

## Overview

This SOP creates strategic roadmaps that bridge the gap between Vision and achieving greatness through systematic identification of keystone products. The roadmap focuses on solving real-world problems identified through Market Research and Client Success Blueprint work, sequencing product development to build sustainable competitive advantage over time.

**Total Time:** 2-3 hours using AI-powered prompts  
**Approach:** Strategic product identification and long-term sequencing  
**Output:** Multi-year roadmap with keystone products and strategic milestones

## Core Philosophy

The Strategic Roadmap is about identifying the essential products we need to build to solve real problems for our ideal people and achieve our vision. This is not operational project management - it's strategic product planning that:

- **Identifies Keystone Products** - Essential products that solve core problems
- **Maps Problem-Solution Fit** - How each product addresses specific gaps
- **Sequences Strategic Development** - Order that builds competitive advantage
- **Creates Long-term Vision** - Multi-year perspective from idea to greatness
- **Focuses on Real Problems** - Products that genuinely help ideal people succeed

## Prerequisites

- Completed Vision and Mission document
- Market and Client Research report
- Client Success Blueprint
- Understanding of keystone product concept (products that enable other products/success)

## The 3-Prompt Strategic Roadmap Process

### Prompt 1: Problem-Solution Mapping and Product Identification (60 minutes)

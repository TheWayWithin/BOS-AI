# Mission: Business Chassis Optimization

## Objective
Analyze and optimize all six Business Chassis multipliers to maximize profit growth.

## Process

### Phase 1: Current State Analysis
1. Assess current metrics for each multiplier:
   - Prospects (market reach)
   - Lead Conversion (interest → lead)
   - Client Conversion (lead → customer)
   - Average Spend (transaction value)
   - Transaction Frequency (repeat business)
   - Margin (profitability)

### Phase 2: Bottleneck Identification
1. Calculate impact potential for each multiplier
2. Identify the weakest link (lowest performing multiplier)
3. Assess improvement difficulty vs. impact

### Phase 3: Optimization Strategy
1. Develop targeted improvement plan for weakest multiplier
2. Create quick wins for 10% improvement across all multipliers
3. Design long-term optimization roadmap

### Phase 4: Implementation Coordination
1. Assign specialized agents to each optimization area
2. Set measurable targets and timelines
3. Establish tracking and reporting systems

## Success Metrics
- Minimum 10% improvement in weakest multiplier
- 5% improvement across all other multipliers
- Overall profit increase of 30%+ within 90 days

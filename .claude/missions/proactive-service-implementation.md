### Phase 2: Proactive Intervention Protocols (45 minutes)

**Lead**: @retention-strategy  
**Support**: @customer-success  
**Objective**: Design proactive intervention protocols for different success health scenarios and optimization opportunities

```bash
@retention-strategy Develop proactive service intervention and optimization protocols:
1. Create intervention protocols for each success health status (Thriving: optimization, Stable: coaching, At-Risk: recovery, Critical: intensive support)
2. Design success optimization protocols for customers achieving strong results (expansion opportunities, best practice sharing, advocacy development)
3. Establish early warning response procedures that address issues before they impact customer success
4. Create success coaching frameworks for helping customers maximize value and overcome challenges
5. Develop customer success milestone celebration protocols that reinforce achievement and strengthen relationships
6. Design preventive service activities that address common challenges before they become issues
```

**Deliverables**:
- Intervention protocols for all success health status categories

### Phase 3: Automated Success Support Systems (45 minutes)

**Lead**: @support-management  
**Support**: @customer-success, @retention-strategy  
**Objective**: Implement automated success support systems that scale proactive service without overwhelming resources

```bash
@support-management Implement automated proactive service and success support systems:
1. Create automated success check-in sequences triggered by customer milestones, usage patterns, and time intervals
2. Design smart content delivery system that provides relevant resources based on customer success stage and challenges
3. Establish automated success celebration system that acknowledges milestones and reinforces value
4. Create early warning notification system that alerts to customer success risks requiring human intervention

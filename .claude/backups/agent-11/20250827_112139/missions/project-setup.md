# Project Setup Mission

## Mission Briefing
Initialize a new BOS-AI powered project with complete document structure, baseline assets, and tracking systems for Business Chassis optimization.

## Mission Objectives
1. Create complete directory structure for document management
2. Initialize core business document templates
3. Set up Business Chassis tracking systems
4. Configure agent workspace
5. Establish document naming conventions and filing standards

## Mission Workflow

### Phase 1: Directory Structure Creation
- [ ] Create `/documents/business-assets/` for core business documents
- [ ] Create `/documents/sops/` for standard operating procedures
- [ ] Create `/documents/policies/` for business policies
- [ ] Create `/documents/references/` for methodology guides
- [ ] Create `/assets/reports/` for generated analysis
- [ ] Create `/assets/performance-data/` for metrics tracking
- [ ] Create `/assets/strategic-plans/` for planning documents
- [ ] Create `/assets/client-success-blueprint/` for client documents

### Phase 2: Initialize Core Documents
- [ ] Create `client-success-blueprint.md` from template
- [ ] Create `marketing-bible.md` from template
- [ ] Create `sales-playbook.md` from template
- [ ] Create `operations-manual.md` from template
- [ ] Create `financial-dashboard.md` from template
- [ ] Create `strategic-plan.md` from template

### Phase 3: Business Chassis Setup
- [ ] Initialize Business Chassis tracking spreadsheet
- [ ] Document baseline metrics (6 multipliers)
- [ ] Set up weekly review schedule
- [ ] Create first performance benchmark
- [ ] Calculate initial multiplication factor

### Phase 4: Configure Workspace
- [ ] Deploy CLAUDE.md command documentation
- [ ] Configure agent access permissions
- [ ] Set up version control (if applicable)
- [ ] Create project README.md
- [ ] Document project-specific requirements

### Phase 5: Establish Standards
- [ ] Document filing naming convention (YYYY-MM-DD-type-description.md)
- [ ] Create document update protocols
- [ ] Set up review and approval workflows
- [ ] Establish backup procedures
- [ ] Create quick reference guide

## Agent Coordination
- **@chassis-intelligence** - Overall project orchestration
- **@strategic-opportunity** - Business model configuration
- **@solution-design** - Document template customization
- **@quality-assurance** - Standards verification
- **@performance-analysis** - Metrics system setup

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All directories created and accessible
- [ ] Core documents initialized with project information
- [ ] Business Chassis baseline metrics recorded
- [ ] Agent filing protocols confirmed working
- [ ] Documentation complete and accessible

## Time Estimate
- Initial Setup: 2-3 hours
- Document Customization: 2-4 hours
- Full Configuration: 1-2 days

## Business Value
- **Immediate**: Organized structure reduces setup time by 80%
- **Short-term**: Consistent filing saves 5+ hours/week
- **Long-term**: Professional documentation supports 10x valuation for acquisition

## Notes
This mission should be run at the start of every new BOS-AI project to ensure consistent structure and optimal Business Chassis tracking from day one.

### Phase 5: Validation & Cleanup (Days 16-20)

#### Document Validation:
- Verify all foundation documents exist
- Check cross-references between documents
- Validate consistency of information
- Ensure naming conventions followed
- Confirm filing structure compliance

#### Archive Management:
- Create `/archive/legacy/YYYY-MM-DD/` folder
- Move obsolete documents with clear labels
- Document why items were archived
- Create archive index for reference
- Set retention policy

## Migration Decision Framework

### Keep and Migrate When:
- Document is current (< 6 months old)
- Content aligns with current strategy
- Information is accurate and valuable
- Document is actively referenced

### Archive When:
- Document is outdated (> 1 year)
- Strategy has changed significantly
- Information is no longer accurate
- Better version exists elsewhere

### Merge When:
- Multiple documents cover same topic
- Information is scattered
- Consolidation improves clarity
- Combined document is more valuable

### Create New When:
- Foundation document doesn't exist
- Existing document quality is poor
- Current version is incomplete
- Fresh start is more efficient

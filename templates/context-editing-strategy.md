# BOS-AI Context Editing Strategy

Strategic context management for long-running business transformations, enabling 24+ hour autonomous business missions through intelligent context preservation and refresh patterns.

## Strategic /clear Usage Framework

### When to Use Strategic Context Clearing

**Long-Running Business Transformations** (4+ hours):
- Market expansion initiatives (geographic or demographic)
- Comprehensive business process overhauls
- Complete business system implementations (marketing, sales, service, finance)
- Strategic partnership development and negotiations
- Business model pivots or major product launches

**Context Refresh Triggers**:
- Mission duration exceeds 3-4 hours of continuous work
- Token consumption approaching context limits
- Context pollution from multiple agent handoffs
- Transition between major mission phases
- Complex multi-agent coordination requirements

### Context Preservation Protocol

**Before Strategic /clear**:
1. **Update Progress Tracking**: Ensure all current progress is documented in progress.md
2. **Update Memory Files**: Transfer any new business intelligence to appropriate memory files
3. **Update Handoff Notes**: Document current state for agent continuity
4. **Save Mission State**: Preserve mission objectives and current phase in mission files
5. **Document Context Markers**: Note key decisions and context points for restoration

**After Strategic /clear**:
1. **Read Memory Files**: Restore business intelligence and historical context
2. **Read Progress Tracking**: Understand mission history and current status
3. **Read Handoff Notes**: Restore agent communication context
4. **Read Mission State**: Understand current objectives and phase
5. **Validate Context**: Ensure no critical information was lost

### Business Mission Phase Management

**Phase 1: Strategic Planning** (Use full context):
- Market research and competitive analysis
- Customer journey mapping and persona development
- Business strategy formulation and goal setting
- Resource allocation and timeline planning
- Success metrics definition and tracking setup

**Phase 2: Foundation Building** (Strategic /clear recommended):
- Infrastructure setup and system configuration
- Team organization and role definition
- Process design and workflow optimization
- Technology stack implementation
- Initial testing and validation

**Phase 3: Implementation** (Strategic /clear between major components):
- Marketing system deployment and campaign execution
- Sales process implementation and team training
- Customer service system setup and testing
- Financial system integration and reporting
- Quality assurance and performance monitoring

**Phase 4: Optimization** (Strategic /clear after major iterations):
- Performance analysis and bottleneck identification
- Process refinement and efficiency improvements
- System integration and automation enhancement
- Team performance optimization and training
- Customer feedback integration and adaptation

**Phase 5: Scaling** (Strategic /clear between scaling stages):
- Capacity expansion and resource scaling
- Geographic or demographic market expansion
- System performance optimization and infrastructure scaling
- Team expansion and organizational development
- Strategic partnership development and integration

### Context Editing Best Practices

**Memory-First Approach**:
- Always update memory files before clearing context
- Use memory files as primary context restoration mechanism
- Maintain cross-session continuity through memory intelligence
- Build institutional knowledge that survives context changes

**Progress Preservation**:
- Document ALL solution attempts, not just final solutions
- Include business rationale and decision context
- Record lessons learned and pattern recognition
- Maintain continuity of business intelligence

**Agent Handoff Optimization**:
- Use handoff-notes.md for inter-agent context preservation
- Include sufficient context for agents to resume work effectively
- Document decisions made and rationale for future reference
- Maintain business continuity across agent transitions

**Strategic /clear Timing**:
- Between major mission phases rather than mid-task
- When transitioning between different business domains
- Before complex multi-agent coordination activities
- When context becomes cluttered with operational details

### Long-Running Mission Examples

**Complete Marketing System Implementation** (8-12 hours):
- Phase 1: Marketing strategy and persona development (2-3 hours)
- Strategic /clear + Memory update
- Phase 2: Marketing Bible and plan creation (2-3 hours)
- Strategic /clear + Memory update  
- Phase 3: Content calendar and campaign setup (2-3 hours)
- Strategic /clear + Memory update
- Phase 4: Implementation testing and optimization (2-3 hours)

**Market Expansion Initiative** (12-16 hours):
- Phase 1: Market research and opportunity validation (3-4 hours)
- Strategic /clear + Memory update
- Phase 2: Market entry strategy and resource planning (3-4 hours)
- Strategic /clear + Memory update
- Phase 3: Infrastructure setup and local adaptation (3-4 hours)
- Strategic /clear + Memory update
- Phase 4: Launch execution and performance monitoring (3-4 hours)

**Business Model Pivot** (16-24 hours):
- Phase 1: Current state analysis and pivot rationale (4-6 hours)
- Strategic /clear + Memory update
- Phase 2: New business model design and validation (4-6 hours)
- Strategic /clear + Memory update
- Phase 3: Transition planning and risk mitigation (4-6 hours)
- Strategic /clear + Memory update
- Phase 4: Implementation and stakeholder communication (4-6 hours)

### Token Optimization Strategy

**Context Efficiency Gains**:
- 75% token reduction through strategic context management
- Fresh context at each phase prevents pollution
- Memory preservation ensures zero knowledge loss
- Optimal cognitive resource allocation per phase

**Resource Allocation**:
- Strategic phases use higher thinking modes with full context
- Implementation phases use efficient thinking modes with fresh context
- Operational phases use standard thinking modes with minimal context
- Optimization phases use analytical thinking modes with performance data

**Performance Monitoring**:
- Track token consumption per mission phase
- Monitor context effectiveness and agent performance
- Measure business outcome delivery across phases
- Optimize context patterns based on mission success

### Integration with Existing Systems

**Memory System Integration**:
- Context editing works seamlessly with memory files
- Business intelligence preserved across context clears
- Cross-session learning maintained through memory
- Institutional knowledge accumulates over time

**Progress Tracking Integration**:
- Context markers documented in progress.md
- Mission phase transitions tracked and analyzed
- Business outcomes preserved across context changes
- Learning extraction continues across phases

**Agent Coordination Integration**:
- Handoff protocols preserve agent context
- Multi-agent missions benefit from fresh context per phase
- Agent specialization optimized through context management
- Business continuity maintained through proper handoffs

This context editing strategy enables sustainable long-running business transformations while maintaining optimal performance and business continuity.

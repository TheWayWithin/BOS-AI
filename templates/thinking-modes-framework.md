- Tactical agents (think hard/think) handle execution phases
- Operational agents (think/standard) handle monitoring and reporting

**Crisis Management**:
- Escalate to appropriate thinking mode based on business impact
- Financial crisis: investment-strategy (ultrathink)
- Customer crisis: client-success-intelligence (think hard)
- Operational crisis: delivery-optimization (think)

**Routine Operations**:
- Use standard thinking modes for established processes
- Escalate to higher thinking modes when patterns change or issues arise
- Monitor cognitive resource allocation for optimal efficiency

This framework ensures optimal cognitive resource allocation while maximizing business decision quality and strategic outcomes.

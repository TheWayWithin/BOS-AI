### 4. File Naming Convention Standardization

#### Naming Rules:
- **Files:** `lowercase-with-hyphens.md`
- **Directories:** `lowercase-with-hyphens/`
- **Agents:** `function-role.md` (e.g., `market-intelligence.md`)
- **Missions:** `action-objective.md` (e.g., `chassis-optimization.md`)
- **Documents:** `document-type.md` (e.g., `marketing-bible.md`)

## Implementation Phases

## Migration Strategy

### Step 1: Backup Current Structure
```bash
# Create backup of current structure
cp -r /Users/jamiewatters/DevProjects/BOS-AI /Users/jamiewatters/DevProjects/BOS-AI-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

### Step 2: Create New Directory Structure
```bash
# Create standard document library
mkdir -p documents/{business-assets,sops,policies,references}

# Restructure agents directory
mkdir -p agents/{coordination,discovery,creation,delivery,growth}
mkdir -p agents/{marketing,sales,customer-service,financial,legal}

# Enhance missions structure
mkdir -p missions/{business-setup,discovery,creation,delivery,growth}
mkdir -p missions/{operations,optimization}
```

### Step 3: Migrate Existing Content
- Move existing agent files to new structure
- Rename files to match conventions
- Update internal references
- Preserve git history

### Step 4: Create Standard Documents
- Generate document templates
- Populate with framework content
- Establish update procedures
- Define ownership roles

Generated: $(date)

## Configuration Summary

```
No project MCPs configured
```

## Known Working MCP Packages

These are the correct package names that actually exist:
- `@playwright/mcp` - Playwright browser automation
- `@upstash/context7-mcp` - Context7 documentation
- `firecrawl-mcp` - Web scraping
- `@edjl/github-mcp` - GitHub integration (uses GITHUB_TOKEN env var)
- `@supabase/mcp-server-supabase@latest` - Official Supabase MCP
- `figma-developer-mcp` - Figma design

## Next Steps

1. Exit Claude Code: `/exit`
2. Restart Claude Code: `claude`
3. Look for MCP tools prefixed with `mcp__`
4. Test specific MCPs:
   - Playwright: Look for `mcp__playwright__` tools
   - Supabase: Look for `mcp__supabase__` tools
   - Context7: Look for `mcp__context7__` tools

## Troubleshooting

- **MCP not appearing**: Restart Claude Code is required
- **Configuration fails**: Check API keys in .env.mcp
- **Package not found**: May need global install: `npm install -g <package>`
- **Connection failed**: Normal until Claude Code restart

# BOS-AI Business Operating System - Project Plan

**Project:** BOS-AI Pure Business Operating System  
**Last Updated:** September 2, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ FULLY OPERATIONAL - ALL AGENTS DOCUMENT-ENABLED

## Project Overview

BOS-AI is a comprehensive Business Operating System that manages business operations through 30 specialized agents, all now properly configured with Claude Code tools to create and save business documents including Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) for technical implementation by separate AGENT-11 development projects.

## System Architecture

```
BOS-AI (Business Layer)          →    PRD    →    AGENT-11 (Development Layer)
• 30 Business Agents                              • 11 Technical Agents
• Business Strategy                               • Software Development
• Customer Success                                • Testing & QA
• Revenue Operations                              • Deployment & DevOps
• Creates Requirements                            • Implements Solutions
```

## Key Achievements

### Business Focus Maintained
- 100% of agents focused on business operations
- 0 technical implementation agents in BOS-AI
- Clear PRD-based handoff to development teams

### Documentation Complete
- 18 Document Library items
- 27 business missions documented
- BOUNDARIES.md enforcing separation
- CLAUDE.md with command system and recovery instructions
- Rule #1 established for agent development workflow

### Deployment Ready
- deploy-bos-ai.sh script tested and working
- All 30 agents properly configured with YAML frontmatter and tools
- Clean installation process with proper directory structure
- GitHub repository synchronized
- Agents can create documents without manual intervention

### Enhanced Mission Execution
- Mandatory planning phase prevents lost progress
- TodoWrite integration for task tracking
- Checkpoint system enables crash recovery
- Mission dashboard provides real-time visibility
- Templates accelerate common mission types

## Critical Boundaries Enforced

### BOS-AI MUST:
✅ Define business requirements (WHAT)
✅ Create PRDs for technical needs
✅ Manage business operations
✅ Optimize Business Chassis metrics

### BOS-AI MUST NOT:
❌ Write production code
❌ Design technical architecture
❌ Perform software testing
❌ Handle deployment/DevOps
❌ Make technology decisions

## Operational Metrics

| Component | Target | Actual | Status |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|
| Business Agents | 30 | 30 | ✅ |
| Agents with Write Tools | 30 | 30 | ✅ |
| Technical Agents in BOS-AI | 0 | 0 | ✅ |
| Business Missions | 27+ | 27 | ✅ |
| Technical Missions | 0 | 0 (12 archived) | ✅ |
| Document Library | 15+ | 17 | ✅ |
| Boundary Violations | 0 | 0 | ✅ |

## Command System Active

### Available Commands:
- `/coord` - Business orchestration and mission coordination
- `/meeting @agent` - Direct consultation with business specialists

### Available Missions:
- Business setup (foundation, chassis implementation)
- Discovery (market research, competitive analysis)
- Growth (market expansion, revenue optimization)
- Operations (daily/weekly/quarterly reviews)
- Optimization (chassis, multiplication, performance)

## Maintenance Guidelines

### For All Future Updates:
1. **Respect Boundaries** - No technical implementation in BOS-AI
2. **Business Focus** - All additions must be business-oriented
3. **PRD Output** - Technical needs become PRDs, not code
4. **Agent Compliance** - New agents must include boundary guardrails
5. **Mission Validation** - New missions must use only business agents

## Repository Status

**GitHub:** https://github.com/TheWayWithin/BOS-AI  
**Latest Commit:** 8fd9c26  
**Branch:** main  
**Status:** Fully synchronized, enhanced with planning/recovery, and deployment-ready

## Next Steps

The system is fully operational with enforced boundaries. Any future enhancements should focus on:
1. Additional business process templates
2. Enhanced PRD generation capabilities
3. Business metric tracking improvements
4. Customer success methodologies
5. Revenue optimization strategies

## Resource Allocation

### Specialist Agent Assignments
- **@developer**: Directory creation, file migration, structure implementation
- **@documenter**: Professional documentation creation, template population
- **@architect**: Structure validation, compliance verification
- **@tester**: Quality assurance, workflow validation
- **@strategist**: Strategic guidance, business value validation

### Coordination Sequence
1. Foundation → Developer + Documenter (parallel)
2. Agent Restructure → Developer + Architect (sequential)
3. Mission Enhancement → Developer + Documenter (parallel)
4. Documentation Standards → Documenter + Strategist (sequential)
5. Integration & Testing → All specialists (coordinated validation)

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks
- Breaking existing integrations → Maintain compatibility
- Loss of git history → Use proper git commands
- Implementation complexity → Systematic phased approach
- Quality degradation → Continuous quality checkpoints

### Mitigation Strategies
- Create backup before starting
- Document all changes thoroughly
- Implement gradual transition
- Establish quality validation at each phase

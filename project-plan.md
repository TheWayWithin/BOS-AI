## Critical Boundaries Enforced

### BOS-AI MUST:
✅ Define business requirements (WHAT)
✅ Create PRDs for technical needs
✅ Manage business operations
✅ Optimize Business Chassis metrics

### BOS-AI MUST NOT:
❌ Write production code
❌ Design technical architecture
❌ Perform software testing
❌ Handle deployment/DevOps
❌ Make technology decisions

## Operational Metrics

| Component | Target | Actual | Status |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|
| Business Agents | 30 | 30 | ✅ |
| Agents with Write Tools | 30 | 30 | ✅ |
| Technical Agents in BOS-AI | 0 | 0 | ✅ |
| Business Missions | 27+ | 27 | ✅ |
| Technical Missions | 0 | 0 (12 archived) | ✅ |
| Document Library | 15+ | 17 | ✅ |
| Boundary Violations | 0 | 0 | ✅ |
| Context Loss Rate | 0% | 0% | ✅ |
| Mission Recovery Capability | 100% | 100% | ✅ |

## Command System Active

### Available Commands:
- `/coord` - Business orchestration and mission coordination
- `/meeting @agent` - Direct consultation with business specialists

### Available Missions:
- Business setup (foundation, chassis implementation)
- Discovery (market research, competitive analysis)
- Growth (market expansion, revenue optimization)
- Operations (daily/weekly/quarterly reviews)
- Optimization (chassis, multiplication, performance)

## Maintenance Guidelines

### For All Future Updates:
1. **Respect Boundaries** - No technical implementation in BOS-AI
2. **Business Focus** - All additions must be business-oriented
3. **PRD Output** - Technical needs become PRDs, not code
4. **Agent Compliance** - New agents must include boundary guardrails
5. **Mission Validation** - New missions must use only business agents

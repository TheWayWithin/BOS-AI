## 📊 The Business Chassis

**Prospects × Lead Conversion × Client Conversion × Average Spend × Transaction Frequency × Margin = Profit**

The Business Chassis provides the mathematical foundation for exponential business results through systematic optimization of the six components that multiply to create profit. When each component improves by 10%, the compound effect creates 61% profit increase. 100% improvement in each component creates 3,200% profit increase.

echo "🚀 Deploying BOS-AI Core System..."

# Create core directory structure
mkdir -p .bos-ai/{agents,missions,assets,configs}

# Deploy Central Intelligence agents
cp agents/coordination/* .bos-ai/agents/

# Deploy Four Engine agents
cp agents/discovery/* .bos-ai/agents/
cp agents/creation/* .bos-ai/agents/
cp agents/delivery/* .bos-ai/agents/
cp agents/growth/* .bos-ai/agents/

# Deploy core missions
cp missions/business-setup/* .bos-ai/missions/
cp missions/operations/* .bos-ai/missions/

# Deploy essential templates
cp templates/business-assets/client-success-blueprint-template.md .bos-ai/assets/
cp templates/sops/chassis-optimization-sop.md .bos-ai/assets/

echo "✅ BOS-AI Core System deployed successfully!"

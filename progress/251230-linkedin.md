**I stopped trying to do everything myself.**

Instead, I built a 30-agent AI team to run my business.

Here's the setup:

**BOS-AI** = 30 specialized business agents
- Strategy & market research
- Marketing & sales
- Customer success
- Finance & operations

**AGENT-11** = 11 technical agents
- Architecture & development
- Testing & deployment

The workflow:

1. BOS-AI creates my business foundation + PRD (1-2 days)
2. AGENT-11 builds the product (1-4 weeks)
3. BOS-AI sets up operations (1-2 days)
4. BOS-AI optimizes for growth (ongoing)

The secret sauce? The Business Chassis formula:

Profit = Prospects × Lead Conversion × Client Conversion × Average Spend × Transaction Frequency × Margin

10% improvement in each = 77% profit increase.

Most founders optimize one thing obsessively.
This system optimizes all six simultaneously.

Stop adding. Start multiplying.

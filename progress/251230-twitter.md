## Option 1: Single Tweet

I built a 30-agent AI team to run my business.

BOS-AI handles strategy, marketing, sales, ops.
AGENT-11 builds the products.

The unlock? Business Chassis formula:

10% better at 6 things = 77% more profit.

Stop adding. Start multiplying.

## Option 2: Thread

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
I stopped wearing all the hats.

Instead, I built a 30-agent AI team to run my business.

Here's how it works: 🧵

**Tweet 2:**
The problem with solo founding:

Monday = CMO
Tuesday = CFO
Wednesday = Developer
Thursday = Support

Result: Decent at everything. Great at nothing.

---

**Tweet 3:**
The solution: Two AI agent systems.

BOS-AI = 30 business agents
• Strategy & research
• Marketing & sales
• Customer success
• Finance & ops

AGENT-11 = 11 dev agents
• Architecture
• Development
• Testing
• Deployment

**Tweet 4:**
The workflow:

1. BOS-AI creates foundation + PRD (1-2 days)
2. AGENT-11 builds product (1-4 weeks)
3. BOS-AI sets up operations (1-2 days)
4. BOS-AI optimizes growth (ongoing)

Separate projects. Clean handoffs.

**Tweet 5:**
The secret: Business Chassis formula.

Profit = Prospects × Conversion × Spend × Frequency × Margin

Most founders optimize ONE thing.
This optimizes SIX things.

10% improvement in each = 77% profit increase.

Multiplication > Addition.

**Tweet 6:**
Getting started:

```
mkdir ~/my-business && cd ~/my-business
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheWayWithin/BOS-AI/main/deployment/scripts/install.sh | bash -s full
```

Then: `/coord foundation-quick-start`

**Tweet 7 (CTA):**
Full breakdown + example SaaS launch timeline:

Both repos are open source:
• github.com/TheWayWithin/BOS-AI
• github.com/TheWayWithin/agent-11

Stop adding. Start multiplying.

## Option 3: Punchy Single Tweet

Solo founders fail because they can't do everything well.

So I built:
• 30 AI agents for business (BOS-AI)
• 11 AI agents for development (AGENT-11)

The Business Chassis formula:
10% better × 6 areas = 77% more profit

Multiplication beats hustle.

## Using Agents in Claude Code

### How to Reference Agents
In your Claude Code session, reference any agent using the @ symbol:

```
@chassis-intelligence - Optimize my Business Chassis
@market-intelligence - Analyze market opportunities
@solution-design - Design a 10x value solution
@customer-success - Improve customer satisfaction
```

### Example Agent Commands

**Business Analysis:**
```
@chassis-intelligence analyze my current metrics and identify the highest leverage improvement area
```

**Market Research:**
```
@market-intelligence research competitors in the [your industry] space and identify gaps
```

**Solution Development:**
```
@solution-design create a solution that delivers 10x value for [specific problem]
```

**Customer Success:**
```
@customer-success develop a retention strategy for my SaaS customers
```

## Post-Installation Setup

### Step 1: Initialize Business Chassis
```bash
./bos-ai-init.sh
```
This displays your Business Chassis components and explains the multiplication formula.

### Step 2: Create Your Baseline
Navigate to `intelligence/business-chassis/` and create your baseline metrics:
- Current prospects count
- Lead conversion rate
- Client conversion rate
- Average transaction value
- Purchase frequency
- Profit margin

### Step 3: Set Your Client Success Blueprint
In `assets/client-success-blueprint/`, define:
- Ideal client profile

- Retention strategies

## Verification

### Check Installation
```bash
# Count installed agents
ls .claude/agents/ | wc -l
# Should show: 30

# View agent list
ls .claude/agents/
```

### Test an Agent
In Claude Code, type:
```
@chassis-intelligence hello
```
The agent should respond with its role and capabilities.
